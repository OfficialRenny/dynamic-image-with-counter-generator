# Image Generator with Counter

Used this to generate a profile counter of sorts for my Steam Profile (another thing itself), like below:

can be used for pretty much anything though i guess. you may want to change the font first - make your own with [Hiero](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Hiero)

Included font is [Oxanium by Severin Meyer, from Google Fonts, under the SIL Open Font License](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxanium)
